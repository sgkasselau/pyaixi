class CTWContextTreeNode:
    """The CTWContextTreeNode class represents a node in an action-conditional
    context tree.

    The purpose of each node is to calculate the weighted probability of
    observing a particular bit sequence.

    In particular, denote by `n` the current node, by `n0` and `n1`  the
    child nodes, by `h_n` the subsequence of the history relevant to node `n`,
    and by `a` and `b` the number of zeros and ones in `h_n`.

    Then the weighted block probability of observing `h_n` at node `n` is
    given by

    P_w^n(h_n) :=

    Pr_kt(h_n)                        (if n is a leaf node)
    1/2 Pr_kt(h_n) +
    1/2 P_w^n0(h_n0) P_w^n1(h_n1)     (otherwise)

    where `Pr_kt(h_n) = Pr_kt(a, b)` is the Krichevsky-Trofimov (KT) estimator
    defined by the relations

    Pr_kt(a + 1, b) = (a + 1/2)/(a + b + 1) Pr_kt(a, b)

    Pr_kt(a, b + 1) = (b + 1/2)/(a + b + 1) Pr_kt(a, b)

    and the base case

    Pr_kt(0, 0) := 1

    In both relations, the fraction is referred to as the update multiplier
    and corresponds to the probability of observing a zero (first relation) or
    a one (second relation) given we have seen `a` zeros and `b` ones.

    Due to numerical issues, the implementation uses logarithmic probabilities
    `log(P_w^n(h_n))` and `log(Pr_kt(h_n)` rather than normal probabilities.

    These probabilities are recalculated during updates (`update()`)
    and reversions (`revert()`) to the context tree that involves the node.

    - The KT estimate is accessed and stored using `log_kt`.
    It is updated from the previous estimate by multiplying with the update
    multiplier as calculated by `log_kt_multiplier()`.

    - The weighted probability is access and stored using `log_probability`.
    It is recalculated by `update_log_probability()`.

    In order to calculate these probabilities, `CTWContextTreeNode` also
    stores:

    - Links to child nodes: `children`

    - The number of symbols (zeros and ones) in the history subsequence
    relevant to the node: `symbol_count`.

    The `CTWContextTreeNode` class is tightly coupled with the `ContextTree`
    class.

    Briefly, the `ContextTree` class:

    - Creates and deletes nodes.

    - Tells the appropriate nodes to update/revert their probability estimates.

    - Samples actions and percepts from the probability distribution specified
    by the nodes."""
